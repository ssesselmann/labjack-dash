Labjack-U3-Dashboard (BETA VERSION 0.1)
---------------------------------------

This project is a dashboard for the Labjack U3 written in Python for Linux. 

The program allows the user to monitor, control and record 4 analogue inputs, 
two analogue outputs and one digital counter channel.

The run time data is saved to an sqlite database and can be exported to 
a csv file if required. 

The program was written for an amateur fusion experiment but can easily be
adapted for other experiments using the Labjack U3.

All instrument names and calibrations can be customised for individual requirements.

Feel free to download and use the code or make improvements in a separate branch.

Instructions
------------
After installing the Labjack drivers, simply download all files
in this folder, then run the file called run.py

Either run the program from the command line or from Sublime text 
by pressing [ctrl] + [b] to build.

Then point your browser to the server IP address and port number in the run file.

MAC OS
------
If you are using Mac Os there is a fully compiled version
in the folder called labjack-dash/dist/run.app


Acknowledgements
----------------
I would like to thank my two sons Erik and Tom for patiently helping me get 
up to speed with the Python language and the quirks of Dash.
